### Background

I made this repository as part of [HackSheffield 8](https://hacksheffield-8.devpost.com/), which successfully won our team the ["Most Creative Use of GitHub" prize](https://devpost.com/software/what-does-it-do).
This was just a small part of what our team submitted, you can find the full submission [here](https://github.com/jhaworth21/HackSheffield8).

This idea was inspired by the book [Tic Tac Tome: The Autonomous Tic Tac Toe Playing Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1594746877), which implements the same idea but uses page numbers instead of links.
